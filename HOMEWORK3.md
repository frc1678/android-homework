#Homework 3

Welcome back! I must say, you are tenacious. HOWEVER! This project will prove more difficult, and will require even more ingenuity and technique to accomplish. It is about Listviews and, more importantly, creating Listviews programmatically. You see, lists are a very important and effective way to display a lot of information, and is commonly used in many android applications. Learn them, live them, love them. Now, before we begin, here are some useful resources that you may need along your journey:

[ListViews](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/listview.html)

[ListAdapters](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListAdapter.html)

So, since you're here, I assume you've completed homework 2, and you should have an application that looks someting like this:

![MainActivity](Images/chat1.png)
![ChatActivity](Images/chat2.png)

So, the application is beginning to take shape! But if this chat app is going to work, it will need some way to display the chat messages! But how will that be accomplished?, you may ask. Well, let me introduce ListViews and ListAdapters. Now, you may remember that your app already has an embedded ListView. In layman's terms, a Listview is basically the (scrollable) space on the screen that allows users to look at all the different cells, or in this case, chat messages.

So, to actually put cells in your little ListView, you're going to have to use ListAdapters. I think that is enough of a hint for a capable individual like you. However, one more thing before I go: As of right now, there isn't anything to actually put in the cells(we don't have a data source yet), so do not worry about customizing the cells too much(just be sure you know how when the time comes. And trust me, it will come). 


Best of luck, and I'll see you again in homework 4!
