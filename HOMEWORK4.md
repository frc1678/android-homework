#Homework 4

Welcome back! You are doing very well indeed, and I am pleased to announce that you have made it to the final stage of the process. But that does not mean that you are almost finished. No, this part may prove to be the most difficult. You must navigate APIs, networking, and a myriad of other ideas and concepts to accomplish this chat application. 

First things first, we will be using a service called Firebase. You can get to their website simply by clicking the following link. I also advise you follow the instructions that they provide so that you can integrate Firebase into your application:
https://www.firebase.com/docs/android/guide/setup.html

It may be advisable to look into JSON, or Javascript Object Notation ( A way to conventiently transfer data ), since this is basically the structure that Firebase uses to store data.

Assuming you've done all the other assignments, which you should have, *cough* *cough*, you now have a way of displaying the chat messages. However, you're missing one thing...what could that be...oh yeah! Chat messages! Those are probably important. 





done.
